## üìö Career Narrative (Short Version)

I began my journey with a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering, quickly discovering my passion for CAD tools and programming. My career started in machine design, where I automated design and reporting processes using tools like Excel, VBA, and CATIA. Moving to Eastman Crusher, I developed parametric CAD models and streamlined engineering workflows using Inventor and iLogic.

At MACMET, I expanded into automation and data integration, building tools in Python, SQL, and PowerShell for reporting, data migration, and system customization, especially with Autodesk Vault. I also led and contributed to several side projects‚Äîincluding ERP, LMS, and IoT solutions‚Äîgaining full-stack experience.

Currently, at Flexur Systems, I specialize in developing and maintaining automation tools for PDM/PLM systems, enhancing workflows with C#, Java, JavaScript, and DevOps skills. My goal is to become a solutions architect for engineering applications, leveraging my diverse technical expertise to deliver impactful solutions.
